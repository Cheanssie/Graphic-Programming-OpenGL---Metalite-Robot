## Technologies Utilization
We employed C++ for its versatility and performance capabilities, allowing us to efficiently implement complex algorithms and control mechanisms for the robot. Besides, leveraging the power of OpenGL, a powerful graphics library, we crafted stunning 3D visualizations and animations to give life to the robot model.
